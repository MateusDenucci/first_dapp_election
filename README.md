# first_dapp_election

This project is my first dAPP built for the Ethereum network. I followed the tutorial on [Dapp University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk) and made some modifications to make it work (since the tutorial was 4 years old when I followed it).

The dApp is a election application where an User can vote in one of the two candidates.

## How to run (after installing everything)

1. run ganoche
2. truffle migrate
3. npm run dev
